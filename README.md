# Doom Emacs config

As soon as I got things [the way I liked them in Spacemacs][1], I started over again with Doom Emacs.

[1]: https://github.com/otherjoel/spacemacs-config

My customizations:

* Focused on Racket and Pollen
* Support Fossil as well as Git
* `SPC t F` to cycle through preferred fonts
* `SPC t T` to cycle through preferred themes
* Restores Mac OS keybindings for proper punctuation (single/double quotes, ellipses, dashes)
